# Crowdfunding Back End
{{ Vexx }}

## Planning:
### Concept/Name
{{ Vexx (from the word vexatious) is a crowdfunding platform designed for users who want to create crowdfunding projects targeted towards fixing environmental issues that may not be addressed either adequately or at all by the government. }}

### Intended Audience/User Stories
{{ The intended audience are people who are dissatisfied with the lack of action and impact the government has on the Australian ecosystem. Users are able to create projects that are intended to fix/positively impact important ecological issues and then other users can support the project by pledging. An example of this would be a project aimed at reestablishing black cockatoo feeding territory by a crowdfunded nursery that educates people about the dwindling food supply caused by development. They also grow and supply discounted trees to consumers. }}

### Front End Pages/Functionality
- {{ A page on the front end }}
    - {{ A list of dot-points showing functionality is available on this page }}
    - {{ etc }}
    - {{ etc }}
- {{ A second page available on the front end }}
    - {{ Another list of dot-points showing functionality }}
    - {{ etc }}

### API Spec
{{ Fill out the table below to define your endpoints. An example of what this might look like is shown at the bottom of the page. 

It might look messy here in the PDF, but once it's rendered it looks very neat! 

It can be helpful to keep the markdown preview open in VS Code so that you can see what you're typing more easily. }}
